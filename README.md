# Missing integer

Write a function:

```def solution(S)```

that, given a string S consisting of N characters returns true if:
* S is empty;
* count of '(' characters is the same as count of ')' characters ;

For example:
* for given string ")(()" the function returns true.
* for given string "(()" the function returns false.

## Input ranges

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

* N is an integer within the range [0..200,000];
* string S consists only of the following characters: "(" and/or ")".
